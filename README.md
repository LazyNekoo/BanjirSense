# 🌊 BanjirSense
## AI-Powered Flood Prediction, Survival Guidance & National Response Coordination System

> Not just preventive — but responsive and actionable.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Malaysia experiences recurring large-scale monsoon floods and sudden urban flash floods that disrupt communities, displace thousands, and strain emergency response systems every year.

While official platforms such as **Public InfoBanjir (JPS)**, **MyCuaca**, and **NADMA** provide rainfall data, river levels, and disaster updates, they primarily function as monitoring systems rather than real-time decision-support tools.

There remains a critical gap between:

- Flood monitoring  
- Personalized risk understanding  
- Immediate action guidance  
- Structured citizen-to-authority coordination  

During flood emergencies, individuals often face:

- Uncertainty about what actions to take  
- Lack of location-specific risk clarity  
- Delays in reporting distress situations  
- Difficulty communicating severity and special needs  
- Limited structured coordination between affected individuals and responders  

Flash floods, in particular, occur rapidly with minimal warning — leaving victims little time to prepare or evacuate.

> The challenge is not the absence of flood data —  
> but the absence of actionable, AI-powered decision support and coordinated response infrastructure.

---

## 🧠 AI Justification & Design Rationale

### 🔹 Gemini AI Justification

Gemini was chosen to generate structured, risk-aware survival guidance dynamically, enabling personalized decision support instead of static informational alerts.  
Instead of displaying generic flood warnings, Gemini produces concise, actionable preparation steps tailored to the user’s real-time risk level and context.  
This improves clarity, reduces decision delay, and enhances emergency readiness.

---

### 🔹 Vertex AI Justification

The Vertex AI-ready architecture enables scalable, machine learning-based flood prediction.

This design ensures future deployment of data-driven flood forecasting without requiring architectural redesign, supporting long-term scalability and government-level integration.

---

### 🔹 Vision API Justification (Phase 2)

The Google Cloud Vision API is planned for AI-assisted severity validation during emergency reporting.  
When users upload images in Stranded Mode, Vision will:

- Detect water level presence and coverage
- Estimate environmental severity indicators
- Reduce false or misleading distress reports
- Assist in rescue prioritization logic

This ensures ethical and responsible AI usage by validating emergency conditions before resource allocation, improving accuracy and operational efficiency in disaster response coordination.

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges & Engineering Decisions

### 🔹 Challenge 1: Incomplete Government Data (Null Coordinates)

Some JPS monitoring stations returned `null` latitude and longitude values, preventing accurate nearest-station detection and distance calculations.

#### ✅ Solution:
- Implemented a backend **data normalization layer** to clean and standardize incoming station data.
- Added a **10-minute caching mechanism** to reduce repeated API calls and improve stability.
- Introduced a **fallback coordinate mapping strategy** for demo-region stations to ensure continuity in risk detection and display.

This ensured reliable nearest-station computation and improved system robustness.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 2: Secure Frontend–Backend Authentication

Ensuring that only authenticated users could access protected backend routes (e.g., `/users`, `/dependents`, `/sos`) required secure token validation beyond frontend-only authentication.

#### ✅ Solution:
- Implemented **Firebase ID token retrieval** on the frontend.
- Verified tokens server-side using the **Firebase Admin SDK**.
- Secured backend routes using middleware-based token validation.
- Structured user data storage under authenticated UID paths:
  - `users/{uid}`
  - `users/{uid}/dependents`

This ensured secure communication between frontend and backend, preventing unauthorized API access.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 3: Government API Payload Shape Variability

The JPS and JKM endpoints returned inconsistent response formats:
- Sometimes `{ ok, shelters: [...] }`
- Sometimes raw arrays `[...]`
- Sometimes nested objects like `{ points: [...] }`

This created runtime instability in the frontend.

#### ✅ Solution:
- Implemented defensive response parsing logic
- Added fallback extraction checks
- Created normalization helpers before UI rendering
- Ensured frontend only consumes standardized data structure

This improved system robustness against unpredictable external APIs.

---

### 🔹 Challenge 4: Balancing AI Automation with Ethical Responsibility

Using AI for emergency prioritization raises ethical concerns:
- Over-prioritization risk
- False positives
- Bias in severity detection

#### ✅ Engineering Decision:
- Combine AI output with official government data
- Plan Vision API validation before automatic prioritization
- Keep human-in-the-loop rescue coordination concept

This ensures responsible AI deployment in disaster management.
